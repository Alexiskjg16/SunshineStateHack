        <h2> What is it? </h2>  
            <p> An online event where you meet with other creatives, developers, and health care workers
                 who all have a common goal of using technology to solve the problems we face related to 
                 the current pandemic. Problem sets are not limited to the health care field. You are 
                 encouraged to think broadly when deciding on a challenge your team would like to solve. 
                 Solutions can address global or local issues.  Some ideas to get you started, but in no 
                 way are limited to health, vulnerable populations, small local business, community, 
                 education, entertainment, beaches,  and parks.
